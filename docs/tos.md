# Antedium — Terms of Service

Effective date: 17 August 2025

By inviting or using Antedium, you agree to these Terms.

### 1) Who we are

“Antedium”, operated by the user @glky (“I”), is a Discord bot that scans new messages to detect certain social media links and reposts a fixed, properly-embedding link. If the Bot has permission, it may delete the original message after posting the fixed link. It also supports per-user notification preferences. 

### 2) Your responsibilities

Only invite the Bot to servers where you have authority to do so and grant the requested permissions (Send/Embed/Manage Messages, Read Message History.). 

Do not use the Bot to violate Discord’s Terms or Community Guidelines, applicable laws, or to harass, spam, or infringe others’ rights.

If you do not want the Bot to delete original messages, withhold the Manage Messages permission on your server. 

### 3) Availability & changes

The Bot is provided “as is” with no uptime guarantees. Features and these Terms may change at any time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date” above.

### 4) Termination

I may remove the Bot from any server or block usage at our discretion. You may remove the Bot at any time.

### 5) Liability

To the extent permitted by law, I are not liable for indirect or consequential losses arising from your use of the Bot. Nothing limits liability that cannot be limited by law.

### 6) Contact

Questions about these Terms can be raised as an issue on this Github repository.

### 7) AI Usage

The majority of the contents in this TOS document are created by AI, as this is a for fun side project and a TOS is required by Discord to verify an app. All contents herein have been read, edited and approved by me (the developer).
