# Antedium — Privacy Policy

Effective date: 17 August 2025

I respect your privacy. This Policy explains what I (the Bot operator) process, why, and how to exercise your rights.

### 1) What the Bot does (and why we read Message Content)

Antedium reads new message content solely to detect supported social-media links and to post a corrected, properly embedding link. No message content of any sort is stored.

If granted Manage Messages, the Bot may remove embeds from the original message after posting the fixed link to keep channels tidy. 

### 2) Data we store

The Bot keeps minimal usage statistics only: counts of how many links were fixed, grouped by link type (e.g., Twitter/Instagram), and associated with the user who posted the link and the server where it was posted. The Bot may also store a simple notification preference (on/off) if you use the /notifications toggle. No message content is stored. 

### 3) Where data is stored

Data is written to log files stored on a New Jersey, US based server. No third-party analytics or processors are used. 
Running the Bot locally means logs stay local to the host. 
GitHub

### 4) Retention

Usage counters are kept until the Bot owner resets logs. We do not store message content or any user details outside of the user ID.

### 5) Sharing

We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data may be disclosed if required by law.

### 6) Security

We apply reasonable technical and organisational measures appropriate for a small utility bot (restricted host access, least-privilege credentials). No method is 100% secure. 

The Bot requests the minimal permissions required for effective usage. Removing the Manage Messages permissions is the only extra precaution that can be taken when adding to a server, noting it will create extra visual clutter with the original and new embed co-existing.

### 7) International users

By using the Bot, you understand your data may be processed outside your region.

### 8) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy; the “Effective date” will always show the latest version. Material changes will be announced in the repository or support server.

### 9) Contact

Privacy questions or requests may be raised as an issue on this Github repository.

### 10) AI Usage

The majority of the contents in this privacy document are created by AI, as this is a for fun side project and a privacy is required by Discord to verify an app. All contents herein have been read, edited and approved by me (the developer).
